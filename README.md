# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

# ASSESMENT ITSELF

you are given working react app which serves as config panel for one of the algorithms for our adaptive control service (Trac).

Its pretty old, made when i was not aware of react hooks, so its class based.

**The task is to refactor the app to functional components and demonstrate it**, whick means you have to create an Api with persistent layer with the corresponding endpoints found in `trac-api.ts` in services folder. Connect the api in `config.ts`

Api may be done with any technology, the only requirement if in Python - FastApi.  
You may use interfaces from the corresponding folder when designing db schema.  

Anyway, the frontend part of the assesment has more value, but only if it works - so without backend it won't go, so don't bother much with the backend, a working one is sufficient, but don't allow duplicates in db. Design improvement ot the UI sticking to used bootstrap is very welcome. 

Deliverables - a repo or 2 (for react and backend) with the code to assess and test.  
If any considerations about how to run - please provide how-to, especially on how to build db schema(sql script, migrations), if db not initialized on startup.

Good luck!
